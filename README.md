Ethiopian Medical Telegram Data Pipeline
This project implements a complete, production-style data pipeline for analyzing Ethiopian medical Telegram channels. The pipeline scrapes messages and images, transforms raw data into a structured data warehouse, enriches images using computer vision, exposes analytics through a REST API, and orchestrates the entire workflow using Dagster.

What This Project Does
The pipeline performs five tightly integrated tasks:

• Scrapes messages and images from public Ethiopian medical Telegram channels
• Stores raw data in a structured data lake (JSON + images)
• Transforms raw data into a clean PostgreSQL data warehouse using dbt
• Enriches image data using YOLO object detection
• Exposes analytical insights via a FastAPI service
• Automates everything using Dagster orchestration

This ensures the data is reliable, testable, observable, and production-ready.

Data Sources
Public Telegram channels related to Ethiopian medical businesses, including:

Chemed
Lobelia Cosmetics
Tikvah Pharma
Additional channels from https://et.tgstat.com/medicine
Pipeline Architecture
Telegram → Raw Data Lake → PostgreSQL (Raw) → dbt Staging → dbt Star Schema → YOLO Image Enrichment → Analytical API (FastAPI) → Orchestrated with Dagster

Task Summary
Task 1 – Data Scraping & Collection
Extract message ID, date, text, views, forwards, and media info
Download images per channel and message
Store raw data as JSON partitioned by date and channel
Log scraping activity and errors
Task 2 – Data Modeling & Transformation
Load raw JSON into PostgreSQL (raw.telegram_messages)
Clean and standardize data using dbt staging models
Build a star schema:
dim_channels
dim_dates
fct_messages
Enforce data quality with dbt tests
Generate dbt documentation
Task 3 – Image Enrichment (YOLO)
Run YOLOv8 object detection on scraped images
Detect objects and confidence scores
Classify images as:
promotional
product_display
lifestyle
other
Store results in fct_image_detections
Task 4 – Analytical API
FastAPI exposes warehouse insights through REST endpoints:

Top mentioned products
Channel activity trends
Keyword-based message search
Visual content statistics
Includes Pydantic validation and OpenAPI documentation.
Task 5 – Pipeline Orchestration
Dagster coordinates the entire workflow
Ensures correct execution order
Supports scheduling, logging, monitoring, and failure alerts
